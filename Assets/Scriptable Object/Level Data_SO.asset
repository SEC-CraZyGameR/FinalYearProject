      signApplication: 'This sign warnsthat there is a right hand (left hand) bend

        may find difficult to negotiate without reducing
        speed significantly - and

        where he cannot easily see how sharp it
        is. Bends which come after a long

        straight section, or which are
        very different from other bends on the road, are

        particularly dangerous
        and may need to be signed. Thissign tendsto be overused, and this confuses
        drivers and makes the signing appear silly and

        unnecessary.'

        bend. The size of the sign and distance from the
